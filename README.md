# botnet_detection
Botnet is a form of malware that attacks computers on the internet and controls them with command and control servers to perform a wide variety of automated tasks, including sending spam emails and performing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.This project is developed using Machine Learning.In this project we see that a decision tree model is being used to detect bots from a dataset.One of the most well known botnet datasets is called the CTU-13 dataset. It is a labeled dataset with botnet, normal, and background traffic delivered by CTU University, Czech Republic.
